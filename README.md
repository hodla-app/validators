Hey there, awesome validator folks!

If you want your own personalized website on Hodla, just shoot a DM to @superhyped on Telegram. We'll walk you through all the cool stuff and talk about the terms of partnership!

After that, all you gotta do is make a PR in this repository, and voil√†, we'll work our magic to create your very own space in Hodla.

Creating your space is pretty easy:
0. We have two folders for devnet (devValidators) and mainnet (validators) credentials. If needed, feel free to create your validator page in devnet first. 
1. Head to the "validators" folder and create a new folder with your validator name, please note that the folder must be named in lowercase. Let's say your folder name is "examplevalidator" (yep, it's already there for you to check out the reference), then your link will be **app.hodla.org/examplevalidator**.
2. Inside the folder, add a JSON file named **_config.json_**. You can see an example of the format [here](https://github.com/hodla-app/validators/blob/main/devValidators/testval/config.json). Here are some tips:
- Required fields: "name" and "networks" (gotta have at least one element in the networks array). The remaining fields are optional, but if you want a higher conversion rate into staked assets, it's recommended to provide more information!
- Keep your validator name short, think mobile-friendly.
- Describe your validator briefly and snappily; long descriptions can be a bummer on mobile phones. Max: 512 characters.
3. Oh, and don't forget to throw in your cool icon (totally optional, though!). Go for a 512x512 or 1024x1024 PNG format, but if you decided to attach your icon, name it **_logo.png_**, please :) 

Once you've done all that and made a PR, our team will work their magic and, in case of approval, automatically create your personal space in Hodla.

We're stoked to have you on board!
